# Roll20 Critical Hit/Fail Sound Effect

This Roll20 API script will play a sound effect any time a player rolls critical hit or a critical fail. 
This script is compatible with the Shaped 5e character sheet macros.

##Setup:
Install the script on Roll20, then select 2 sounds in the Jukebox.

Name one sound 'Critical Hit' and the other 'Critical Fail'.

The script will automatically play these sounds when a player rolls a natural 20 or natural 1 on a d20.
